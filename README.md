# Power-BI-Project: Anaylsis of Bigfoot Sightings in the US

This project forms part of the monthly dataDNA challenges sponsored by Pomerol Partners, a leading data analytics and visualization consultancy. In February 2023, Pomeral Partners shared publicly the BigFoot Sightings Dataset on their website ([see here](https://pomerolpartners.com/dataset_challenge/february-2023/)). Data analysts were to use the data to identify key trends and traits of Bigfoot, the ape-like creature inhibiting North American forests. I participated in the challenge and the present project showcases my report.

## The Analysis Process

The raw dataset was retrieved from [Pomeral Partners](https://pomerolpartners.com/dataset_challenge/february-2023/). MS Excel and PowerBI were used to clean and transform the data. Finally, PowerBI was used for visualization and generation of the final report.

## Key Takeways
1. Most bigfoot sightings were reported in: 
        i) Washington state
        ii) Jackson, Piers, and Jefferson counties
2. The trends show that bigfoot sightings have been dropping since 2004
3. What are bigfoot's favorable weather conditions:
        i) Summertime
        ii) Gentle breeze - low wind speed
        iii) High humidity - over 50%
        iv) Moderately chilly and warm temperatures
        v) Clear visibility - Most sightings were reported when the visibility score was 10 mile
        vii) Low precipitation intensity
